# broken-elevator
This program will tell a user the best path to a floor given some problems with the elevator. The user should enter how many floors there are in the building, what floor they're starting on, their goal floor, the number of floors the elevator can go up at a time, and the number of floors the elevator can go down at a time.  If it is impossible to reach the floor, the program will tell the user to take the stairs.
